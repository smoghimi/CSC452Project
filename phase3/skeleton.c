     * system calls cannot be invoked from kernel mode.

     * with lower-case names.  I.e., Spawn is the user-mode function
     * called by the test cases; spawn is the kernel-mode function that
     * is called by the syscallHandler; spawnReal is the function that
     * contains the implementation and is called by spawn.
     *
     * Spawn() is in libuser.c.  It invokes USLOSS_Syscall()
     * The system call handler calls a function named spawn() -- note lower
     * case -- that extracts the arguments from the sysargs pointer, and
     * checks them for possible errors.  This function then calls spawnReal().
     *
     * Here, we only call spawnReal(), since we are already in kernel mode.
     *
     * spawnReal() will create the process by using a call to fork1 to
     * create a process executing the code in spawnLaunch().  spawnReal()
     * and spawnLaunch() then coordinate the completion of the phase 3
     * process table entries needed for the new process.  spawnReal() will
     * return to the original caller of Spawn, while spawnLaunch() will
     * begin executing the function passed to Spawn. spawnLaunch() will
     * need to switch to user-mode before allowing user code to execute.
     * spawnReal() will return to spawn(), which will put the return
     * values back into the sysargs pointer, switch to user-mode, and 
     * return to the user code that called Spawn.
