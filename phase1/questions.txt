1. I need some help with understanding statuses.
	Ready: The process is ready to be run and in a ready list.
	Blocked: The process (is\isn't) running and (is\isn't) in a ready list?
	Quit: The process has quit

2.  In the spec it says that a parent that has called join is blocked until ONE of its
	children has called quit. So if a parent has 2 children and calls join we block it. But
	what happens when one child quits?
