1.	The only time a process should be on the ready list is when its status is ready?

2.	Can a parent have more than 1 child? For example is each process a tree structure with 1-n
	children or is it a linked list with 1 child which can have 1 child itself etc? What is
	nextSiblingPtr for? This is why I think its a tree structure.

(Next question depends on 2.answer)
3.  In the spec it says that a parent that has called join is blocked until ONE of its
	children has called quit. So if a parent has 2 children and calls join we block it. But
	what happens when one child quits? 

4.	I have the code in join:
	if (Current->childProcPtr->status < 0) {
    	status = &Current->childProcPtr->status;
    	return Current->childProcPtr->pid;
  	}
  	But this does not work? Why do I need to remove the '&' and add a '*'?
    	*status = Current->childProcPtr->status;
	What is the difference?
