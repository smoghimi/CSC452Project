/*
 * The purpose of this test is to test when we join and our children have not
 * yet quit (ie we have to block).  One will be done where we have been zapped
 * before calling join, many will be done where we have not been zapped.
 *
 * Expected output:
 *
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): after fork of child 4
 * start1(): after fork of child 5
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1()'
 * start1(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * start1(): performing second join
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
 * XXp2(): calling zap(5)
 * XXp3(): started
 * XXp3(): arg = `XXp3'
 * XXp3(): after fork of child 6
 * XXp3(): performing first join
 * XXp4(): started
 * XXp4(): arg = `XXp4FromXXp3a'
 * XXp3(): exit status for child -1 is -4
 * start1(): exit status for child 5 is -3
 * XXp2(): return value of zap(5) is 0
 * start1(): exit status for child 4 is -2
 * All processes completed.
